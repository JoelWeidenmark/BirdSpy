# BirdSpy MVP - File Upload Bird Analyzer

**Goal**: Demonstrate core bird identification functionality with a simple, elegant interface

## MVP Overview

Instead of jumping into real-time processing, we'll build a focused file-based analyzer that showcases the essential user experience. Users can upload WAV files and get beautiful, detailed bird identification results.

## Core MVP Features

1. **File Upload Interface**: Simple drag-and-drop for WAV files
2. **BirdNET Analysis**: Process uploaded audio using existing backend
3. **Results Display**: Clean presentation of detected species with confidence scores
4. **Audio Playback**: Play the uploaded file with visual waveform
5. **Species Information**: Basic details about detected birds

## User Flow

```
1. User visits clean, modern web interface
2. User drags/drops a WAV file (or clicks to browse)
3. File uploads with progress indicator
4. Backend processes file through BirdNET
5. Results display:
   - List of detected species with confidence scores
   - Audio player with waveform visualization
   - Species cards with basic information
   - Clean, modern UI showing the analysis
```

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes (Next.js App)

**New Components to Add**:
- `FileUpload` - Drag & drop component with progress
- `AudioPlayer` - Waveform visualization with playback controls
- `SpeciesResults` - Cards displaying detected species
- `AnalysisView` - Main page combining all components

**Technology Stack**:
- Next.js 15 with TypeScript (existing)
- Tailwind CSS for styling (existing)
- **Add**: WaveSurfer.js for audio visualization
- **Add**: React Dropzone for file uploads
- **Add**: Framer Motion for smooth animations

### Backend Changes (Python/BirdNET)

**New Endpoint to Add**:
```python
POST /analyze
- Accept multipart file upload
- Process through existing BirdNET analyzer
- Return structured JSON response with:
  - Detected species list
  - Confidence scores
  - Timestamps for each detection
  - Audio file metadata
```

**Enhanced Response Format**:
```json
{
  "analysis_id": "uuid",
  "filename": "uploaded_file.wav",
  "duration": 30.5,
  "processed_at": "2025-06-06T10:30:00Z",
  "detections": [
    {
      "species": "Turdus migratorius",
      "common_name": "American Robin",
      "confidence": 0.89,
      "start_time": 5.2,
      "end_time": 8.1
    }
  ],
  "file_url": "/audio/uuid.wav"
}
```

## What We're NOT Building (Yet)

- ❌ Continuous audio capture
- ❌ WebSocket connections
- ❌ Database persistence (can use in-memory or file storage)
- ❌ Complex infrastructure
- ❌ User accounts or authentication
- ❌ Historical tracking
- ❌ Real-time monitoring

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Upload and analyze a WAV file end-to-end
- [ ] Display species detection results clearly
- [ ] Play audio with visual waveform feedback
- [ ] Responsive, intuitive user interface
- [ ] Process files under 30 seconds
- [ ] Handle common audio formats (WAV, MP3)
- [ ] Clean error handling for invalid files
- [ ] Works in Docker containers

## MVP Deliverables

1. **Working Demo**: Complete file upload → analysis → results flow
2. **Audio Visualization**: Waveform display with playback controls
3. **Species Results**: Beautiful cards showing detected birds with confidence
4. **Responsive UI**: Works well on desktop and mobile
5. **Docker Setup**: Both frontend and backend running in containers

## Development Tasks

### Phase 1: Core Functionality

**Backend Tasks**:
- [ ] Add file upload endpoint to existing server
- [ ] Implement multipart file handling
- [ ] Enhance response format with structured data
- [ ] Add basic error handling and validation
- [ ] Test with sample WAV files

**Frontend Tasks**:
- [ ] Install required dependencies (WaveSurfer.js, React Dropzone)
- [ ] Create file upload component with drag & drop
- [ ] Build audio player with waveform visualization
- [ ] Design species results display
- [ ] Connect frontend to backend API

### Phase 2: Polish & Testing

**UI/UX Tasks**:
- [ ] Add loading states and progress indicators
- [ ] Improve error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Add animations and micro-interactions
- [ ] Test responsive design on different devices
- [ ] Polish visual design and typography

**Integration Tasks**:
- [ ] Test with various WAV file formats
- [ ] Optimize file upload performance
- [ ] Add file size limits and validation
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Verify Docker container setup

## Sample Test Files

For testing the MVP, we'll use:
- Short bird call samples (3-10 seconds)
- Longer recordings with multiple species
- Different audio qualities and formats
- Edge cases (silence, noise, very quiet recordings)

## Future Evolution Path

This MVP provides the foundation for all future features:
- File upload → Real-time audio capture
- Single analysis → Continuous monitoring  
- Simple results → Historical tracking
- Basic UI → Advanced dashboard
- Local processing → Multi-device deployment

## Getting Started

1. **Setup Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   cd birdspy-app
   npm install wavesurfer.js react-dropzone framer-motion
   
   # Backend - already configured in existing Docker setup
   ```

2. **Development Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Start both services
   docker-compose up
   
   # Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   # Backend: http://localhost:5000
   ```

3. **First Implementation**: Start with the file upload component in the frontend, then add the `/analyze` endpoint to the backend.

---

**Success Definition**: A user can visit the web interface, upload a bird recording, and see beautiful, accurate species identification results with audio playback - all within 30 seconds and with an intuitive, delightful user experience.
